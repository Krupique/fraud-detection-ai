# Documentation for the Real Estate Transaction Fraud Detection Project Using LLM

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Context

The real estate industry is one of the most profitable and complex sectors of the global economy. However, this complexity also makes it vulnerable to fraudulent activities. Fraud in real estate transactions can range from document forgery to property value manipulation and suspicious transactions. These activities not only cause significant financial losses but also damage the reputation of the involved companies and erode customer trust.

### 1.2. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a fraud detection system for real estate transactions using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs). The system aims to identify suspicious transactions based on historical data patterns and specific characteristics that may indicate fraudulent activities.

## 2. Project Description

### 2.1. Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
```bash
fraud-detection-ai/
|-- app/  # Source code
|   |-- 01-ExecPipeline.py  # Pipeline orchestrator
|   |-- 02-CreateTables.py  # Database creation
|   |-- 03-LoadData.py  # Data loading
|   |-- 04-RunLLM.py  # AI model execution
|   |-- ProjectDatabase-Tables.sql  # SQL script for table creation
|
|-- data/  # CSV data
|   |-- customers.csv
|   |-- financial_transactions.csv
|   |-- properties.csv
|   |-- transactions_history.csv
|
|-- results/  # Analysis results
|   |-- insights.md  # Report generated by the LLM
|
|-- .gitignore
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- poetry.lock
|-- README.md
```

- **Root directory:** `fraud-detection-ai`
  - **app:** Contains the project logic, including Python and SQL scripts.
  - **data:** Stores CSV files with transaction, customer, property, and transaction history data.
  - **results:** Stores the results generated by the system, such as fraud detection insights.
  - **Configuration files:** `.gitignore`, `poetry.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`.

### 2.2. Project Components

#### 2.2.1. SQL Script (`ProjectDatabase-Tables.sql`)

This script is responsible for creating the database schema and the necessary tables to store real estate transaction data. The tables include:

- **customers:** Stores customer information.
- **properties:** Stores property details.
- **financial_transactions:** Records financial transactions related to properties.
- **transactions_history:** Maintains a history of transaction modifications.

#### 2.2.2. Python Script (`01-ExecPipeline.py`)

This script is the entry point of the project. It executes a pipeline that includes creating a Docker container for the PostgreSQL database, installing project dependencies using Poetry, and running subsequent Python scripts.

#### 2.2.3. Python Script (`02-CreateTables.py`)

This script connects to the PostgreSQL database and executes the SQL script to create the necessary tables.

#### 2.2.4. Python Script (`03-LoadData.py`)

This script loads data from CSV files into the corresponding tables in the PostgreSQL database.

#### 2.2.5. Python Script (`04-RunLLM.py`)

This script uses a large language model (LLM) to analyze transaction data and generate insights about potential fraud. It queries the database for suspicious transactions and uses the LLM to generate detailed descriptions of these transactions.

### 2.3. Technologies Used

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.1
- **Package Management:** Poetry
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.12
- **AI Models:** Llama3 via Ollama
- **Frameworks:** LangChain, SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2
- **Containerization:** Docker

## 3. Benefits and Strengths of the Project

### 3.1. Automated Fraud Detection

The system automates the fraud detection process, reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing efficiency in identifying suspicious transactions.

### 3.2. Real-Time Data Analysis

With the integration of a robust database like PostgreSQL, the system can analyze large volumes of data in real-time, providing immediate insights into potential fraud.

### 3.3. Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs allows for deeper and more contextual data analysis, identifying complex patterns that may not be detected by traditional methods.

### 3.4. Scalability

The project's architecture is highly scalable, allowing for the addition of new data and the expansion of functionalities as needed.

### 3.5. Cost Reduction

By proactively detecting fraud, the system helps reduce significant financial losses, protecting the resources of the company and its clients.

## 4. Conclusion

This project represents an innovative and effective solution for detecting fraud in real estate transactions. By combining advanced data analysis techniques with large language models, the system offers a robust and scalable approach to identifying and preventing fraudulent activities. The implementation of this project not only protects the financial interests of companies but also strengthens customer trust in the real estate market.

## 5. How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Krupique/fraud-detection-ai
    cd fraud-detection-ai
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. Run the pipeline:
    ```bash
    poetry run python app/01-ExecPipeline.py
    ```

4. Check the generated insights in `results/insights.md`.

## 5. Next Steps

- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Integrate the system with other real estate transaction management platforms.
- **Expansion of the Data Model:** Include more variables and data sources to improve fraud detection accuracy.
- **Continuous Model Training:** Implement a continuous training mechanism for the LLM, using new data and feedback to enhance fraud detection.
